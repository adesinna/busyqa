Key Elements

Workflows:
    A GitHub Actions workflow defines a series of steps that are automatically
    executed based on specific events or schedules in your GitHub repository.
    It helps automate tasks such as running tests, building projects,
    deploying code, or any custom job.

    They might be one or more workflow attached to a repo


Jobs:
    A job is a collection of steps that are executed sequentially in a
    specific environment (e.g., on a specific operating system).
    Jobs are defined within the jobs section of the workflow file and run on different
    virtual machines (called runners).
    You can define multiple jobs that either run in parallel or are dependent on other jobs.

Key Characteristics:
    Runs in isolation:
        Each job runs in a clean, separate environment (e.g., a new virtual machine
        or container) unless configured to share data via artifacts or caching.

    Parallel or sequential execution:
        By default, jobs run in parallel. If a job depends on another job,
        it can be specified using the needs keyword.

    Different environments:
        You can specify different operating systems for
        each job (e.g., ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest).
