To dockerize your own application, you must create a docker file and
do it the way you would do it manually.

Most languages have their on way and base images, just build on that

Terminologies


FROM: This is  the base image that you are building from

LABELS: This adds metadata to an image, like a tag

RUN: These are the shell commands it will execute

CMD: The command you will run

ADD/COPY: Adds files and folder into the image

ENTRYPOINT: Allows you to configure the container that will run executables

VOLUME: Creates a mount point and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes

EXPOSE: Containers listens on the port specified here

ENV: To set environment variable

USER: Sets the username

WORKDIR: Set a working directory, there is where the command will run

ARG: Variables the users can pass at the build time

ONBUILD: Adds to the image a trigger instruction to be executed at a later time




How to build Images

    1. Download the source code

    2. Create a docker file in that folder

    3. docker build -t image_name .  # you can add .dockerignore file

    4. run the image locally

    5. Tag and push to dockerhub

            docker build -t adesinna/image_name:V1 . # tag it

            docker login

            Enter password and username

            docker push adesinna/image_name:V1


We used a multi-stage docker file for some apps that require building first like java
