Containers are completely isolated environments which containers everything that an application needs to run.

So as long as anyone has docker, they would be able to run it

The image shows the difference between VM and Docker containers

What is a docker image ?
    A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and immutable file that contains the source code,
    libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files necessary for an application to run.
    It serves as a blueprint for creating Docker containers.

What is a docker container?

    A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image.
    It encapsulates the application and its dependencies, running as an isolated process on the host operating system.
    Containers can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted.


Images are like classes in python while the containers are like objects in the class.

So you can get many objects from the classes, and the class give the footprint of the object.
