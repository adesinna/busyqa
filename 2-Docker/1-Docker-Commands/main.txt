docker pull image

    This would go to dockerhub and pull down the image if its exits


docker run image

    This would check whether the image exits locally, if not it pulls it from
    dockerhub and run the container

    # Run an Nginx container in detached mode
     docker run -d --name name_of_container -p host_port:container_port image_name

     docker run -d --name my_nginx -p 8080:80 nginx

     docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash # to enter the container os






docker ps

    This would show all running container


docker ps -a

    This would show all containers including the terminated ones


docker stop container_id/name

    This would stop the container

    To stop all
         docker stop $(docker ps -q)



docker rm container_id/name

    This would remove the container and make sure it does not consume space

    To remove all stopped and running containers
        docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)


    To do both
        docker stop $(docker ps -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

    To remove all stopped containers

        docker rm $(docker ps -a -q --filter "status=exited")


docker images

    Shows you all the images


docker rmi image_name
    This would remove the image



A docker container is only alive as the process in it

    docker run ubuntu sleep 60  # it would run for 60sec and die


docker run image:tag

    This tag is like the version, if no tag it would just get the latest

docker run -it image_id/name

    This would give a tag

docker run -it image_name/id

    If the container requires a prompt, this would allow you to supply value

docker inspect container

    This gives you details about the contianer

    curl ip_of_container # this can only be done from the docker host


docker logs container_id

    This shows the logs of the container

    docker logs -f container_id
        This helps you see it in real time


Docker Volumes
    This allows you to persist data, incase the container dies another can pick

    docker run -v path_on_host:path_in_container image
