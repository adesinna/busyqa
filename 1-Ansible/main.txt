Creating Inventory File:
    use the inventory

    make sure you put the key in the location of the inventory and do chmod 400 key # do not copy the %

    sudo -i


    cd /etc/ansible/


    ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg # this will generate the configuration file  but uncomment that line first

    vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

    host_key_checking = False # remove the semicolon at the beginning

    Now run ansible as ubuntu user



Configuration settings
    When you want to change defaults, we use configuration file

    Priority:
    ANSIBLE_CONFIG(environment variable set)

    ansible.cfg(in the current directory)

    ~/.ansible.cfg(the hidden file in home directory)

    /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

    Go to the documentation and check the settings for each configuration

    Creating your own configuration file:

    ansible.cfg

    now you can execute play book

    ansible-playbook name_of_yaml


Verifying playbooks

    check mode:
        It will tell what it would do and no changes would be made

           ansible-playbook name_of_yaml --check

    diff mode:
        It will show you before and after

            ansible-playbook name_of_yaml --check --diff

    syntax check mode:
        Checks of error

        ansible-playbook name_of_yaml --syntax-check


Ansible-lint: # you have to install ansible lint
    ansible-lint playbook_name
