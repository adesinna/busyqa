The cluster consist of many nodes, and both humans and machine would need to access
the cluster.

- admins
- developers
- bots
- end users


All user access is managed by the kube-apiserver, it authenticates the request before
processing it.

Authentications mechanism

- Static password file
- Static token file
- Certificates
- Identity services like LDAP


Static password and token file:
    You could create a list of users and password in a csv file and use them for
    authentication.

    Then pass this file as an option to the kube api server
    --basic-auth-file=user-details.csv # same things goes for token

    This is not the best way to secure your cluster


Certificates:
    --key admin.key
    --cert admin.crt
    --cacert ca.crt

This must be passed to authenticate using cert, more of this in the
