Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is one of the most widely used authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes.
It allows administrators to define roles with specific permissions and then assign
those roles to users, groups, or service accounts.

Key Features:
Roles and RoleBindings: A role defines a set of permissions (e.g., "can read pods"). A RoleBinding assigns a role to
a user, group, or service account within a specific namespace.

ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings: Similar to Roles, but ClusterRoles can be applied across the entire cluster,
and ClusterRoleBindings assign these roles at the cluster level.

Granularity: RBAC provides fine-grained control over who can perform what actions on which
resources within specific namespaces or across the entire cluster.

Roles are namespace while cluster roles is cluster wide
