Every pod needs an amount of resources for it to run on the node.

Resources are the needed memory and cpus the pod needs,  while the limit is the maximum
resources it can use on a node.

see 1-pod-1.yaml

The scheduler looks for a node that have this resource available, the limit is the max it can consume
on the node which the pod is scheduled.

see pod-2.yaml

However, a pod cannot consume more than its cpu limit but can exceed the limit of the memory,
and the pod will be terminated.

The best is to just set request without using limits. Because if pod A is limited and there is extra
resource, it wont be able to get it. Dont restrict pods if the others pods can free their resources.

Limit Range
    This works at the namespace level, the request
