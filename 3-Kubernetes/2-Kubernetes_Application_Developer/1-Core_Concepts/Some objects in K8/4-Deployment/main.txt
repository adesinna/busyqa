Deployment allows you to create pods and replica sets, this will allow you to be able to scale in and scale out depending
on the need.


kubectl create -f deploy.yaml

kubectl get deploy #

kubectl get rs

kubectl get pods

kubectl delete deploy deploy_name

You can make changes to the definition file

kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml

kubectl rollout status deployment_name # this will get the status of the deployment

kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment # this would go to the previous version

kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment # this would check history of deployment

kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=<revision-number> # goes to the specific deployment
