When you create a terraform state file, it works like etcd in k8s
it allows you monitor the state of the infrastructure created.

I init

V validate

F fmt

P plan

A apply

D destroy

rm -rf .terraform*
rm -rf terraform.tfstate*

Note:

Certificate worked by just putting CNAME record for in namecheap
Also cname record for loadbalancer
