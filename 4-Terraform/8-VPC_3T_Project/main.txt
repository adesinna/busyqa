Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together.
A module consist of collection of .tf files kept together in a directory.

- Modules are the main way to package and reuse resource configurations with Terraform

- Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as the root module
  which consist of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory

- The root module can call other module into their configuration, the called module is called
  the child module, they can be called multiple times in a configuration and also multiple configuration
  can call a child module.

- It can also load child module from local files or public and private registry
